# SudokuSolver
Two sudoku solvers, both use backtracking technique.

Uses Arto Inkala Sudoku for example

CurseSolver.py uses the [Curses](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/curses.html) to make a nice grid where you can input the board you want to solve.
Move with arrow keys, numbers 1-9 to input numbers 0 to reset a number. Press `Q` to solve the board. Fast for 18 > clue puzzles, a bit slower for 16 and 17 clue puzzles.

SSolver.py is with no imports, need to manually add a board into the SSolver.py file in the boards part, First prints input board and then the solved board.
